# Boilerplate

The Boilerplate is a professional backend template for building fast, robust, and adaptable TypeScript application.

## Quick start

1. Clone the git repo
2. Install dependencies with: `npm ci`
3. Transpile TypeScript into JavaScript with: `npm run build`
4. Start the app with: `npm start`

### Advanced scripts

- `npm test`: lint & run tests
- `npm run lint`: lint
- `npm run lint -- --fix`: lint with auto-fixing
- `npm run typecheck`: typecheck with tsc (without building the code)
- `npm run clean`: clean the build artifact, coverage reports & other temporary files

## Features

- Production ready. Use newest features without worrying about any incompatibility.
- Testing with [`Jest`](https://github.com/facebook/jest)
- Lint the code with airbnb based [`ESLint`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) config & [`Prettier`](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
